## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design techniques
- Background image positioning

### What I Learned

- How to use multiple background images with `background-image`
- Proper use of `position`, `transform: translate`, and `z-index`
- Keeping the footer attribution fixed while maintaining layout flow

```css
background-image: url('top.svg'), url('bottom.svg');
background-position: top left, bottom right;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
```

### Continued Development

I want to continue improving my CSS layout skills, especially using `position`, `z-index`, and working with background image layers more efficiently. I also plan to recreate this layout using Tailwind CSS.
